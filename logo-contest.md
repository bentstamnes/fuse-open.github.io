After Fuse 1.9, the Fuse Open project will need a new logo and/or logomark that
new icon-sets can be based on, to avoid confusion with Fusetools and future
Fusetools projects.

We've decided to involve the community, as it has a lot of creative people who
are great at exactly this kind of thing, and a quick survey of our Slack
group showed great interest in it. This page has all the info you need to
contribute and submit.

## Guidelines:
- Entries should to be visually distinct fron the current ["fat-comma" logo](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20170124005067/en/565461/2/Fuse_logo_Black.jpg).
- It should be possible to create a visually clear icon from the logo, even in
  small resolutions (even 16x16 pixels).
- The logo must work in square (ex: icons) as well as wide (ex: website) formats.
- The logo must be available under the
  [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
- The logo cannot contain fonts that require a license. This means that either
  only license-free fonts may be used, or the font needs to be properly licensed,
  and converted to outlines (or rasterized) before distribution.
- Entries that are obviously jokes, or of offending nature, will not be
  accepted.
- Optional: The logo should spell "Fuse Open".
- Optional: It's very nice if the logo is easy to adopt to spell "Fuse Studio"
  as well.
- Optional: [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) fonts
  are preferred, as they are easier to rescale.

## How to enter
